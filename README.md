### About the Experiment  

This experiment centers on regression and curve-fitting methodologies, with a strategic emphasis on Least-Square and Weighted Least-Square fitting procedures. These approaches serve as core analytical instruments in data modeling, scientific computation, and engineering decision-making. Students gain hands-on exposure to how regression techniques establish mathematical relationships between dependent and independent variables by minimizing error between observed and predicted values. Least-Square fitting provides a foundational framework for line or curve estimations when all data points are considered equally reliable, while Weighted Least-Square introduces variable confidence levels through assigned weights, thereby improving robustness in the presence of outliers or uneven measurement accuracy. The experiment reinforces both conceptual knowledge and practical execution, covering parameter estimation, goodness-of-fit evaluation, and implementation across real-world scenarios such as calibration, performance prediction, and trend analysis.
