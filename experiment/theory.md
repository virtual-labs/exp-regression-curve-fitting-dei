Regression and curve fitting are statistical methods for modeling relationships between variables by finding the best-fitting curve through a set of data points. The core objective is to minimize the difference between observed and predicted values.
The Key Regression Approaches are:
1. Least Squares Method
   - Minimizes the sum of squared vertical distances between data points and the regression line
   - Provides an optimal line that represents the underlying data trend
   - Assumes errors are normally distributed and independent
2. Weighted Least Squares
   - Extends least squares by incorporating weights to account for varying data point reliability
   - Allows differential emphasis on different data points
   - Useful when data points have inherent measurement uncertainties
The implemented regression calculator demonstrates three primary curve-fitting techniques:
1. Linear Regression
- Simple model representing a straight line (y = mx + b)
- Captures linear relationships between variables
- Lowest complexity among regression types
2. Polynomial Regression
- Allows capturing non-linear relationships
- Second-degree polynomial enables more complex curve fitting
- Increases model flexibility compared to linear regression
3. Exponential Regression
- Models relationships with exponential growth or decay
- Transforms data to linear space for coefficient estimation
- Suitable for processes with multiplicative changes

 R-squared (Coefficient of Determination) are:
- Indicates the proportion of variance explained by the regression model
- Ranges from 0 to 1
- Higher values suggest better model fit
- Quantifies the model's predictive power
Implementation Strategies are: 
- Robust error handling
- Flexible input mechanisms
- Visual representation of results
- Support for weighted and unweighted regressions
Computational Approach
- Uses matrix solving techniques (LU decomposition)
- Handles transformation for exponential regression
- Implements comprehensive error calculation
Strengths of the Approach are: 
1. Supports multiple regression types
2. Allows custom data point weighting
3. Provides visual and numerical results
4. Handles various data distributions
5. User-friendly interface for regression analysis
4. Minimal advanced statistical diagnostics
Regression and curve fitting are powerful techniques for understanding data relationships. The implemented web application demonstrates a practical, accessible approach to statistical modeling, enabling users to explore different regression methodologies with ease.
